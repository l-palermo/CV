## About me

I am a Software Developer recently graduated from Makers Academy and I have previously worked as Architect for different firms in London and Italy.

After years studying and working in Architecture, I felt the desire to work on something that has a stronger impact on the user's life. Even if one of the most important tasks of designing a building is to decide how the user experiences the space, I felt the desire to go deeper. I wanted to create products that change people's lives, help them do their work, empower them providing better and more reliable services.

I have always been passionate about tech. The way it is changing our lives really excites me so I started coding and immediately got a lot of satisfaction from it. Logic, quick feedback, stack trace to find my way to the bug and infinite possibilities of what I could have created for the users with it. All these factors convinced me that tech is the way to go to help people build a better world and so realise my wish.

## Skills

#### Quick learner

I learn and apply new concepts quickly and effectively in real-life situations.

When I worked at Aros Architects, I was instructed to be the project architect of a newly built 3 storey office building. I didn’t have any experience in designing for construction but the director was confident in me leading the project. I have succeeded in every aspect, learned from my mistakes and the building is now standing in Maidenhead.

#### Great collaborator  

Teamwork is an essential part to reach great achievements. Every time I join a new team, I listen actively other team members' expectations, ideas and what they need to accomplish so I have all the information to best contribute. I take ownership of my tasks and complete them in time and participate actively to help the team reaching its goals. I always value open and friendly communication.


#### Problem Solving

The work of an Architect is mostly based on solving problems through design, both technical and conceptual. To approach a problem, I break it down to smaller part and analyse its key factors, make the appropriate research, then built a solution and validate it via a test.

#### Reliable and responsible

I always focus on completing my tasks in time without the need for supervision. 
At Aros, I quickly gained trust so I was attending meetings with clients and other consultants independently. My tasks were understanding clients requirements, effectively communicating risks, coordinating structural, mechanical and architectural design with other consultants to achieve the client objectives.

#### Determination

Self-growth is a very important part of my personality. Nothing is impossible, with time and effort everything can be achieved.
