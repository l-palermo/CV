## About me

I am a Software Developer who has just graduated at Makers Academy - 12-week software development Bootcamp. I previously worked as a fully qualified Architect for different firms in London and Italy.

During my studies, both at Makers and at the University of Architecture, I have always been fully focused to achieve the best result.
My interest in tech emerged from the beginning of my Architectural career. I always looked for new software and functionality for drawing, modelling retouching pictures.

As an architect, my goal was to create spaces where people feel comfortable and happy, building the background of their life. It is fascinating seeing how tech is embedded in people's lives and how powerful it is in its ability to change the way we live.

I have decided to change because I want to be part of the tech-world that is changing the way we live and shape the world, creating something that not only the client uses but everyone can enjoy and interact with.

## Skills

#### Hard worker

As an Architect hard work is a must. Long hours and deadlines are at a daily order as well as clients who change their mind at the last minute. Hard-work never scared me and has given me confidence to change career while bringing the same dedication to a new industry.

#### Determination

I am competitive with myself, always willing to challenge my personal limits and driven by improvement. 
Self-growth is a very important part of my personality. Nothing is impossible, with time and commitment everything can be achieved.

#### Problem Solving

The work of an Architect is mostly based on solving problems through design, both technical and conceptual.
To approach a problem, I take time to consider the expected outcome, the logic behind the problem, the steps to get there and research appropriately.

#### Quick learner

I consider myself a quick learner. It doesn't take me long to learn new concepts or methods and applying them in real-life situations. 
At Makers, we learn something new every day. In four months, we've built knowledge in programming languages, Agile methodology self-learning, TDD and many other topics. 

When I Worked at Aros Architects, I was instructed to be project architect of a newly built office building in Maidenhead. I didn't have any experience in site works before but the director I worked with felt confident in letting me lead the project. 
Everything was new including site meetings, client/contractor relationship and all the technical aspects.
I have succeeded in every aspect, learned from any mistakes and the building is standing in Maidenhead today.

Please see below link to the land developer website with a fast-forward video of some moment of the construction.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (29.04.2019 - 16.08.2019)

* Curious and passionate about code<br>
Learning about technologies and new languages is always exciting, this is why I embraced fully the idea of learning a new language (React) for our final project, building a progressive web app that allows the user to find amazing recipes to make with fridge leftovers.

* Great collaborator <br>
Teamwork is one of the main ways to work in Architecture, almost all the project are made in the team. As part of the team, good communication is always important, meeting the team member expectation and deadline to allow a smooth workflow through the all working process.
