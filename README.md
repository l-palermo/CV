## Luigi Palermo

I'm Luigi 34 years old, Italian Architect.
I have trained in Architecture in Italy always achieving high scores and good results but after a couple of years working for a small Architecture practice,
I felt the need to do and see more of the world around me.  
  
In 2015 I have decided to move to London, for its multicultural diversity, world of possibilities, and openness to newcomers. 
What I have imagined was true and I worked for a couple of practices: "SouthStudio Architects" and "Aros Architects".
Challenges were at a daily order, but thanks to my strong will to challenge myself and resolve problems I have been highly appreciated in both practices and 
given roles with high responsibilities where I used to work mostly independently. 
My interest in tech was emerging from the beginning of my Architectural career, always seeking for new software and functionality for drawing, 
modelling retouching pictures until It took over.

The main wish of an Architect is to interact with peoples life creating spaces where they feel comfortable and happy being the background of their life.

In my personal view tech does more, it is a groundbreaking industry that is creating a new world, changing the way we live and interact with each other. 
I would be ideally working for some highly experimental project or doing something that has an impact on the way peoples lives, 
developing new services, website, applications, software. 


## Skills

#### Problem Solving

The work of an Architect is mostly based on solving problems through the design both technical and ideological.
As a foreigner working in an international environment, the challenges have always been many. They way I face them is taking time to carefully thinking 
what the outcome should be, then strategically prioritize tasks, that goes from asking for more information if required, 
researching and apply the result to the work, define what documentation/drawings are needed first in order to have a complete picture of the work.
The continuous process of making questions and find an answer to help in motivating the choices we make to our colleagues and clients and 
makes it easier to find a fault when occurs. 

#### Quick learner

I consider myself a quick learner. It doesn't take me long to learn new concepts or methods and applying them in real life situations. 
Working at Aros Architects, I have been instructed to be project architect of a newly built office building in Maidenhead. 
I didn't have any experience in site works before but the director an the manager I worked with felt confident in let me leading the project. 
Everything was new, site meeting, client/contractor relationship and all the politics included in this kind of process in addition to all the technical aspects that 
requires careful consideration from project to project. I have succeeded in all the aspect of the task, sometimes making mistakes but always learning from them, 
today the building is there.

Please see below link to the developer website with a fast-forward video of some moment of the construction.
