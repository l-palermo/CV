## About me

I am a Software Developer who has graduated at Makers Academy - 12 weeks software development Bootcamp. I previously worked as a fully qualified Architect for different firms in London and Italy.

After years studying and working in Architecture, I felt the need to work on something that has a more direct impact on the user life. The way the user experience the space is the more important part of designing a building but I felt the desire to go deeper and create products that help to solve peoples doing their work, that empowers them, proving better e more reliable services. 

I have always been passionate about tech and the way it is changing our life really excites me. So I started coding and immediately got a lot of satisfaction from it. Logic, quick feedback, stack trace to find my way through the bug and infinite possibilities of what I could have created for the users with it. All these convinced me that tech is the way to go to help peoples build a better world and realise my wish.

## Skills

#### Quick learner

I learn and apply new concepts quickly and effectively in real-life situations.

When I worked at Aros Architects, I was instructed to be the project architect of a newly built 3 storey office building. I didn’t have any experience in designing for construction but the director was confident in me leading the project. I have succeeded in every aspect, learned from my mistakes and the building is now standing in Maidenhead.

Please see below link to the land developer website.

#### Great collaborator  

Teamwork is an essential part of working in Architecture. Every time I join a new team, I listen actively other team members' expectations, ideas and what they need to accomplish to give them better support when needed. I take ownership of my tasks and complete them in time and participate actively to help the team reaching its goals. I always value open and friendly communication.


#### Problem Solving

The work of an Architect is mostly based on solving problems through design, both technical and conceptual. To approach a problem, I break it down to smaller part and analyse its key factors, make the appropriate research, then built a solution and validate it via a test.

#### Reliable and responsible

Both at work and at University I always focused on completing my tasks in time without the need for supervision. 
At Aros, I have always been trusted in attending meetings with clients and other consultants independently. My tasks were understanding clients requirements, effectively communicating risks, coordinating structural, mechanical and architectural design with other consultants to achieve the client objectives. Active listening, clear communication and deliver in time were key factors to allow everyone to do their work. 

#### Determination

Self-growth is a very important part of my personality. Nothing is impossible, with time and effort everything can be achieved.
