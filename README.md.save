## Luigi Palermo

Hello reader! 
I'm Luigi 34 years old fully qualified Italian Architect. 
I have trained in Architecture in Italy always achieving high scores and good results, but after a couples of years working for a small Architecture practice I felt the need to do more and see more of the worls around me.
In 2015 I have decide to move to London, for its multicultural diversity and its world of possibilities. I worked for a couple of practice such as "SouthStudio Architects" and "Aros Architects".
Challeges where at a dayli order  
As a newcomer I have faced many different challeges connected to Architecture that has some differences in the way is practiced from country to contry.
